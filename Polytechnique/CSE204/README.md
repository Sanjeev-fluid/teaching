# CSE 204 - Introduction to Machine Learning (2019)

These labs were created for the course CSE 204 at Ecole Polytechnique, Paris.  They are intended to be understandable by 2nd year Bachelor students in computer science and/or applied mathematics.

### Labs created by Jérémie Decock
The following lab notebooks were created by another Chef de T.D. and are hosted elsewhere.  The following links open the labs in Google Colaboratory.
